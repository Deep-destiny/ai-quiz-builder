# 🤖 AI-Powered Dynamic Quiz Generator

> **⚠️ Status: Repository Migration**
> The source code and API integration modules for this project are currently being migrated for public release. The full repository, including the NLP processing pipeline, will be available by **January 12, 2026**.

## 📝 Overview
**AI Quiz Builder** is an intelligent web application that automates the creation of educational assessments. Instead of manually writing questions, users can provide any text (articles, book chapters, or notes), and the system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to generate relevant Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and descriptive queries instantly.

This project focuses on the intersection of **EdTech and Generative AI**, providing a tool for educators and students to test knowledge with zero manual overhead.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Automated Question Generation:** Uses NLP models to identify key concepts and entities in a text to form contextually accurate questions.
* **Instant Evaluation & Feedback:** Features a real-time scoring engine that evaluates user responses and provides detailed explanations for correct/incorrect answers.
* **Dynamic Content Extraction:** Capable of parsing various input formats (PDF/Text) to create diverse quiz sets.
* **Responsive Dashboard:** A clean, intuitive UI built for both students (taking quizzes) and creators (generating quizzes).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **AI/NLP:** OpenAI API / LangChain / NLTK
* **Database:** MongoDB (to store generated quiz history)
* **API:** RESTful Architecture

## 🔮 Roadmap
- [ ] Integration with GPT-4 for higher reasoning question types.
- [ ] Export functionality to PDF and Google Forms.
- [ ] User authentication and persistent progress tracking.
